## Generations

The Volvo XC40 has gone through one main generation with a significant facelift:

- **First Generation (2017-present)**: Unveiled on September 21, 2017, the Volvo XC40 is the smallest SUV in Volvo's lineup, positioned below the XC60. Built on the Compact Modular Architecture (CMA) platform, it was designed to maximize interior space while maintaining a compact footprint. The first generation XC40 features Volvo's signature design elements including the "Thor's Hammer" daytime running lights and an upright grille adorned with the Iron Mark. It won numerous awards including European Car of the Year in 2018 and Car of the Year Japan for 2018/2019.

  - **Initial Release (2017-2022)**: The original XC40 launched with a variety of powertrain options including 1.5-liter three-cylinder and 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines in both diesel and petrol variants. In the US market, engine choices were limited to the 2.0-liter four-cylinder petrol-powered T4 and T5 models.

  - **Powertrain Updates (2019-2020)**: In 2019, Volvo introduced a plug-in hybrid model named "T5 Twin Engine," combining a 180 hp petrol version of the 1.5-liter engine with a 74 hp electric motor. In 2020, the fully electric XC40 Recharge was released, powered by a 78 kWh battery pack.

  - **Facelift (2023-present)**: In 2022, Volvo unveiled a facelift for the 2023 model year. The refreshed XC40 received aesthetic changes to align it more closely with the C40 Recharge, including updated headlights, bumpers, and integration of Android Automotive for the mild hybrid models. Diesel-powered models were dropped from the lineup. In 2023, Volvo made mild hybrids the base engine option in the US market. The single-motor electric version was revised to adopt a rear-wheel drive layout instead of front-wheel drive, making it the first rear-wheel-drive Volvo vehicle in 25 years.

  - **Naming Update (2024-present)**: In 2024, Volvo renamed the battery electric XC40 to the Volvo EX40, aligning it with newer battery electric models such as the EX30 and EX90. The coupe version of the battery electric model (C40 Recharge) was renamed to EC40.
