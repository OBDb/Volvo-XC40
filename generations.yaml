    description: "The Volvo XC40 is Volvo's first compact luxury crossover SUV, introduced for the 2018 model year as the smallest member of Volvo's SUV lineup. Built on the Compact Modular Architecture (CMA) platform developed with parent company Geely, it features distinctive styling that maintains Volvo's design language while incorporating youthful, urban elements like an available contrasting roof, bold character lines, and the signature Thor's Hammer LED headlights. The interior offers a modern, minimalist approach with high-quality materials, clever storage solutions throughout the cabin, and a 9-inch Sensus touchscreen infotainment system (later updated to a Google-based system). Initially launched with a range of 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines in various states of tune, including the turbocharged T4 and turbo-and-supercharged T5 petrol engines and D3/D4 diesel options in Europe, the lineup has evolved to include mild hybrid and plug-in hybrid variants. The XC40 Recharge pure electric model was added in 2020, marking Volvo's first all-electric production vehicle. Safety features are comprehensive, including City Safety collision avoidance, Pilot Assist semi-autonomous driving capability, and numerous advanced driver assistance systems. The XC40 has been widely praised for successfully translating Volvo's premium characteristics and safety leadership into a smaller, more accessible package, appealing to urban dwellers and younger buyers. A subtle update in 2022 refreshed the exterior styling and interior technology without changing the core formula."
